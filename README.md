# mask-detector
 CNN model for detecting type of mask from facial images

## Project Files
- `main.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook used for the project.
- `demo.py` - Python file to train and test models; used when the Jupyter notebook can't be run.
- `ConvNet5.pkl` - Saved file with the trained model, optimizer, loss function, and epochs.
- `Report.pdf` - Project report.

### Dataset
Generated a new dataset of 4k images by collecting, pre-processing and performing data-augmentation of facial images. Initial data was taken from publicly available datasets, others were sourced from internet.
