- `demo.py` - Python file to train and test models; used when the Jupyter notebook can't be run.
- `ConvNet5.pkl` - Saved file with the trained model, optimizer, loss function, and epochs.
- `Report.pdf` - Project report.

### Image sources
Generated a new dataset of 4k images by collecting, pre-processing and performing data-augmentation of facial
images. Most images were sourced from Kaggle.
